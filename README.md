## Smart Security Camera System for Supermarkets using BLIP and WebSockets

This project aims to develop a smart security camera system tailored for supermarkets. The system leverages BLIP (Blind Image Processing) and WebSockets to monitor multiple camera feeds, detect suspicious activities, and alert human operators in real-time. It also identifies and stores key images that may contain significant events, such as a person picking up an item or a child toying with a product.

### Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Capture and stream video frames from multiple camera sources to a central server.
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Utilize BLIP to analyze video frames and detect suspicious activities.
- **Alert System**: Automatically alert human operators when suspicious activity is detected.
- **Key Image Storage**: Identify and store important events captured by the cameras.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Handle multiple camera streams simultaneously with minimal delay.

### Functional Requirements
- **Alert Human Operator**: Notify operators when suspicious activities are detected.
- **Store Key Images**: Save images of significant events for further review.
- **Easy Integration**: New cameras can connect to the server easily via WebSockets.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Multi-Camera Support**: Process video feeds from multiple sources simultaneously.
- **Efficient Processing**: Ensure a maximum delay of 60 seconds for processing each frame.

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-security-camera-system.git
   cd smart-security-camera-system
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the Flask server:
     ```bash
     python server.py
     ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the camera stream interface.

4. **Using Docker**:
   - Build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t smart-security-camera-system .
     ```
   - Run the Docker container:
     ```bash
     docker run -p 5000:5000 smart-security-camera-system
     ```
